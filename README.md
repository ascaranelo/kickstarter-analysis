Crowfunding Analysis
by AM Scaranelo
We analysed 1,000 crowdfunding campaigns that happened in the 3 of the 5 continents (approximately 81% in America, 15% in Europe and 5% in Oceania, none in Asia or Africa) during the lifespan of about 10 years, i.e. from Jan 2010 to Jan 2020, 

Despite of more than half of the data (56.5%) was showing success of those campaigns, their field were variable and a trend in having more campaigns to support arts (theatre & music as the top two) compared to science or education was noted. The proportion of cancelled campaigns in all arts categories (e.g. theatre, music, film & video and photography) was much higher than cancelled crowdfunding to support technology or publishing, for example.

What is noticeable in the entire data is the willingness to financial support during the Summertime to the Fall in Europe and North America. The warmer months were the top ones that more successful campaigns were funded. One may say that this is indeed one of the limitations of this data. Theatrical plays, rock & jazz concerts as well food trucks are more easily available outdoors during that time of the year on those countries compared to a cold weather month when people tend to remain indoors, unless they are kanucks like us that go outside during snowy days and not just to practice winter sports.

Despite the bias of selection for this data excluding Asian, African and Central-South American countries population, other interesting evaluations that could be done would be to determine if the average donation by supporters follows any pattern as well, if there is a trend to support arts in some specific countries compared to support science technology. Also, someone wants to compare countries related to the reasons for success or cancellations. However, to achieve those goals the data needs to have a different distribution and include representative samples of those regions. For example, the number of cancelled campaigns in the UK is different from other European countries and all the European countries together are different from the cancellations in America. This is because the data is skewed to American countries. Hence, this data may not reflect the entire world pattern of crowdfunding. This is also another limitation.

Many other graphs and table could be created, for example one may wish to know the duration of the campaigns from the time they were launched to the deadline and if there is a trend by parent category or subcategory. This analysis could provide some insights about the average duration of different subcategories and their success or failure, guiding people to explore more reliable ways to achieve their utmost goal, namely economic resources or funding. In addition, graphs demonstrating the currency normalized by another monetary instrument (example bread buns, cups of coffee or glasses of wine) could be creative ways to demonstrate to the public that instead of 1.0 USD equals 0.90 EUR and having to do all the conversions, the monetary unit could be universal. In another way, the crowdfunding campaign will ask you how much was raised in a more fun unit. Something like, some influencer telling the media that he/she/they donated two cup of coffees to that documentary.
